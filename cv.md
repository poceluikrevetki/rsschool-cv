I live and work in China on the island of Hainan, before the pandemic, I worked for the tourism government of the island in order to popularize tourism in Russia. Managed social networks and a website about the island of Hainan in Russian for tourists. I was also involved in the production of photo and video content for travel Internet resources. In connection with the disappearance of foreign tourism in China, I am looking for an opportunity to get a new specialty.
